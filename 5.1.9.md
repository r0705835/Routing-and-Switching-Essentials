# Packet Tracer - Investigate STP Loop Prevention

## Part 1: Observe a Converged Spanning-Tree Instance

PC-1
C:\>ping 192.168.1.101
S1#show spanning-tree vlan 1
S2#show spanning-tree vlan 1
S3#show spanning-tree vlan 1

To know if it's the root bridge compare the Root ID and the Bridge ID, if they're the same you have found the root bridge. A Role of root does not mean they're the root bridge, it means that it's a link going to the root bridge. In this scenario S2 is the root bridge.
Switch  Port    Status  Root Bridge?
S1      G0/1    FWD     No
S1      G0/2    FWD     No
S2      G0/1    FWD     Yes
S2      G0/2    FWD     Yes
S3      G0/1    FWD     No
S3      G0/2    BLK     No

## Part 2: Observe spanning-tree convergence

S3#show spanning-tree vlan 1
Status of G0/2 went from blocking to forwarding.
The ping is succcesful. There are no ports with an orange light, as there are no ports that have a status other than forwarding. Since there is only one path for the whole network every port has to be forwarding for the network to function.
