# Lab - Implement DHCPv4

## Part 1: Build the Network and Configure Basic Device Settings

### Step 1: Establish an addressing scheme

### Step 2: Cable the network as shown in the topology

### Step 3: Configure basic settings for each router

### Step 4: Configure Inter-VLAN Routing on R1

### Step 5: Configure G0/0/1 on R2, then G0/0/0 and static routing for both routers

### Step 6: Configure basic settings for each switch

### Step 7: Create VLANs on S1

### Step 8: Assign VLANs to the correct switch interfaces

### Step 9: Manually configure S1â€™s interface F0/5 as an 802.1Q trunk

## Part 2: Configure and verify two DHCPv4 Servers on R1

### Step 1: Configure R1 with DHCPv4 pools for the two supported subnets. Only the DHCP Pool for subnet A is given below

### Step 2: Save your configuration

### Step 3: Verify the DHCPv4 Server configuration

### Step 4: Attempt to acquire an IP address from DHCP on PC-A

## Part 3: Configure and verify a DHCP Relay on R2

### Step 1: Configure R2 as a DHCP relay agent for the LAN on G0/0/1

### Step 2: Attempt to acquire an IP address from DHCP on PC-B
