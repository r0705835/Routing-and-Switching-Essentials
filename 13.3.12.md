# Packet Tracer - Configure a WPA2 Enterprise WLAN on the WLC

## Part 1: Create a new WLAN

### Step 1: Create a new VLAN interface

go to web browser. URL : <https://192.168.200.254>  

Login with the username admin and password Cisco123.

c.     Click the Controller menu and then click Interfaces from the menu on the left. You will see the default virtual interface and the management interface to which you are connected.

d.     Click the New button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. You may need to scroll the page to the right to see it.

e.     Enter the name of the new interface. We will call it WLAN-5. Configure the VLAN ID as 5. This is the VLAN that will carry traffic for the WLAN that we create later. Click Apply. This leads to a configuration screen for the VLAN interface.

f.      First, configure the interface to use physical port number 1. Multiple VLAN interfaces can use the same physical port because the physical interfaces are like dedicated trunk ports.

g.     Address the interface as follows:

IP Address: 192.168.5.254

Netmask: 255.255.255.0

Gateway: 192.168.5.1

Primary DHCP server: 192.168.5.1

User traffic for the WLAN that uses this VLAN interface will be on the 192.168.5.0/24 network. The default gateway is the address of an interface on router R-1. A DHCP pool has been configured on the router. The address that we configure here for DHCP tells the WLC to forward all DHCP requests that it receives from hosts on the WLAN to the DHCP server on the router.

h.     Be sure to click Apply to enact your changes and click OK to respond to the warning message. Click Save Configuration so that your configuration will be in effect when the WLC restarts.

### Step 2: Configure the WLC to use a RADIUS server

a.     Click the Security menu on the WLC, still in the web browser.

b.     Click the New button and enter the IP address of the RADIUS server in the Server IP Address field.

c.     The RADIUS server will authenticate the WLC before it will allow the WLC to access the user account information that is on the server. This requires a shared secret value. Use Cisco123. Confirm the shared secret and click Apply.

### Step 3: Create a new WLAN

Click WLANs in the WLC menu bar. Locate the dropdown box in the upper right had corner of the WLANs screen. It will say Create New. Click Go to create a new WLAN.

b.     Enter the Profile Name of the new WLAN. Use the profile name Floor 2 Employees. Assign an SSID of SSID-5 to the WLAN. Hosts will need to use this SSID to join the network.

c.     Select the ID for the WLAN. This value is a label that will be used to identify the WLAN is other displays. Select a value of 5 to keep it consistent with the VLAN number and SSID. This is not a requirement but it helps with understanding the topology.

d.     Click Apply so that the settings go into effect.

e.     Now that the WLAN has been created, you can configure features of the network. Click the Enabled checkbox to make the WLAN functional. It is a common mistake to accidentally skip this step.

f.      Choose the VLAN interface that will be used for the WLAN. The WLC will use this interface for user traffic on the network. Click the drop-down box for Interface/Interface Group (G). Select the WLAN-5 interface. This interface was previously configured on the WLC for this activity.

g.     Click the Advanced tab.

h.     Scroll down to the FlexConnect portion of the page. Click to enable FlexConnect Local Switching and FlexConnect Local Auth.

i.      Click Apply to enable the new WLAN. If you forget to do this, the WLAN will not operate.

### Step 4: Configure WLAN security

Instead of WPA2-PSK, we will configure the new WLAN to use WPA2-Enterprise.

a.     Click the WLAN ID of the newly created WLAN to continue configuring it, if necessary.

b.     Click the Security tab. Under the Layer 2 tab, select WPA+WPA2 from the drop-down box.

c.     Under WPA+WPA2 Parameters, enable WPA2 Policy. Click 802.1X under Authentication Key Management. This tells the WLC to use the 802.1X protocol to authenticate users externally.

d.     Click the AAA Servers tab. Open the drop-down next to Server 1 in the Authentication Servers column and select the server that we configured in Step 2.

e.     Click Apply to enact this configuration. You have now configured the WLC to use the RADIUS sever to authenticate users that attempt to connect to the WLAN.

## Part 2: Configure a DHCP Scope and SNMP

### Step 1: Configure a DHCP Scope

WLAN-5, management and virtual are the present interfaces.

Management Interface  
IP address: 192.168.200.254  
Netmask: 255.255.255.0  
Gateway: 192.168.200.1  
Primary DHCP server: 0.0.0.0

Change the primary DHCP server to 192.168.200.254.
.     In the left-hand menu, expand the Internal DHCP Server section. Click DHCP Scope.

f.      To create a DHCP scope, click the New… button.

g.     Name the scope Wired Management. You will configure this DHCP scope to provide addresses to the wired infrastructure network that connects the Admin PC, WLC-1, and LAP-1.

h.     Click Apply to create the new DHCP scope.

i.      Click the new scope in the DHCP Scopes table to configure addressing information for the scope. Enter the following information.

Pool Start Address: 192.168.200.240

Pool End Address: 192.168.200.249

Status: Enabled

Network: 192.168.200.0

Netmask: 255.255.255.0

Default Routers: 192.168.200.1

j.      Click Apply to activate the configuration. Click Save Configuration in the upper-right-hand corner of the WLC interface to save your work so that it is available when the WLC restarts.

The internal DHCP server will now provide an address to LAP-1 after a brief delay. When LAP-1 has its IP address, the CAPWAP tunnel will be established and LAP-1 will be able to provide access to the Floor 2 Employees (SSID-5) WLAN. If you move the mouse over LAP-1 in the topology, you should see its IP address, the status of the CAPWAP tunnel, and the WLAN that LAP-1 is providing access to.

### Step 2: Configure SNMP

a.     Click the Management menu in the WLC GUI and expand the entry for SNMP in the left-hand menu.

b.     Click Trap Receivers and then New…

c.     Enter the community string as WLAN_SNMP and the IP address of the server at 172.31.1.254.

d.     Click Apply to finish the configuration.

## Part 3: Connect Hosts to the Network

### Step 1: Configure a host to connect to the enterprise network

In the Packet Tracer PC Wireless client app, you must configure a WLAN Profile in order to attach to a WPA2-Enterprise WLAN.

a.     Click Wireless Host and open the PC Wireless app.

b.     Click the Profiles tab and then click New to create a new profile. Name the profile WLC NET.

c.     Highlight the Wireless Network Name for the WLAN that we created earlier and click Advanced Setup.

d.     Verify that the SSID for the wireless LAN is present and then click Next. Wireless Host should see SSID-5. If it does not, move the mouse over LAP-1 to verify that it is communicating with the WLC. The popup box should indicate that LAP-1 is aware of SSID-5. If it is not, check the WLC configuration. You can also manually enter the SSID.

e.     Verify that the DHCP network setting is selected and click Next.

f.      In the Security drop down box, select WPA2-Enterprise. Click Next.

g.     Enter login name user1 and the password User1Pass and click Next.

h.     Verify the Profile Settings and click Save.

i.      Select the WLC NET profile and click the Connect button. After a brief delay, you should see the Wireless Host connect to LAP-1. You can click the Fast Forward Time button to speed up the process if it seems to be taking too long.

j.      Confirm that Wireless Host has connected to the WLAN. Wireless Host should receive an IP address from the DHCP server that is configured for hosts on R1. The address will be in the 192.168.5.0/24 network. You may need to click the Fast Forward Time button speed up the process.

### Step 2: Test Connectivity

Wireless Host  
C:\>ipconfig /all  
C:\>ping 192.168.200.100  
C:\>ping 172.31.1.254

It should be in the 192.168.5.0 network. Because it dynamically optained its IP-address with DHCP from that network.

The first thing that is authenticated by the RADIUS server is the WLC to make sure no one can put a rogue controller on the network. The second thing is the host.

The advantages of WPA2-Entrerprise are that if there were multiple access points you may have to authenticate to multiple ones. Now you have a centralised authentication server. You can do auditing with WPA2-Enterprise.
