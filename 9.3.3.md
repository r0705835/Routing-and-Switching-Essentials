# Packet Tracer - HSRP Configuration Guide

## Part 1: Verify Connectivity

### Step 1: Trace the path to the Web Server from PC-A

PC-A  
C:\>tracert 209.165.200.226  
R1, R2 and I-Net

### Step 2: Trace the path to the Web Server from PC-B

PC-B  
C:\>tracert 209.165.200.226  
R3, R2 and I-Net

### Step 3: Observe the network behavior when R3 becomes unavailable

PC-B  
C:\>tracert 209.165.200.226  
Request timed out.
C:\>ping 209.165.200.226

## Part 2: Configure HSRP Active and Standby Routers

### Step 1: Configure HSRP on R1

R1(config)# interface g0/1  
R1(config-if)# standby version 2  
R1(config-if)#standby 1 ip 192.168.1.254  
R1(config-if)#standby 1 priority 150  
R1(config-if)#standby 1 preempt  
HSRP priority of R3 will be 100 because that is the standard value, unless it's been configured differently.

### Step 2: Configure HSRP on R3

R3(config)#int g0/0  
R3(config-if)#standby version 2  
R3(config-if)#standby 1 ip 192.168.1.254  

### Step 3: Verify HSRP Configuration

R1# show standby  
R3# show standby  
R1# show standby brief  
R3# show standby brief  
R1 is the active router. The virtual MAC address is 0000.0C9F.F001. The IP address and priority for the standby router are 192.168.1.3 and 100 respectively.

PC-A and B: change default gateway to 192.168.1.254  
S1(config)#ip default-gateway 192.168.1.254  
S3(config)#ip default-gateway 192.168.1.254  

PC-A  
C:\>ping 209.165.200.226

PC-B
C:\>ping 209.165.200.226

You should use the address 102.168.1.254. The pings are successful.

## Part 3: Observe HSRP Operation

### Step 1: Make the active router become unavailable

PC-B  
C:\>tracert 209.165.200.226  
The path does differ. It went through R1 instead of R3 now.

### Step 2: Break the link to R1

PC-B  
C:\>tracert 209.165.200.226
The path went back to the original one, through R3.

### Step 3: Restore the link to R1

Once the link is restored it took the path through R1 again. If the preempt command was not configured it would have gona througuh R3 instead.
