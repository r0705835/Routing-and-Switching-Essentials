## Part 2: Create a Wireless LAN

### Step 1: Create and enable the WLAN

Click WLANs in the WLC menu bar. Locate the dropdown box in the upper right had corner of the WLANs screen. It will say Create New. Click Go to create a new WLAN.

b.     Enter the Profile Name of the new WLAN. Use the profile name Floor 2 Employees. Assign an SSID of SSID-5 to the WLAN. Hosts will need to use this SSID to join the network.

c.     Select the ID for the WLAN. This value is a label that will be used to identify the WLAN is other displays. Select a value of 5 to keep it consistent with the VLAN number and SSID. This is not a requirement but it helps with understanding the topology.

d.     Click Apply so that the settings go into effect.

e.     Now that the WLAN has been created, you can configure features of the network. Click the Enabled checkbox to make the WLAN functional. It is a common mistake to accidentally skip this step.

f.      Choose the VLAN interface that will be used for the WLAN. The WLC will use this interface for user traffic on the network. Click the drop-down box for Interface/Interface Group (G). Select the WLAN-5 interface. This interface was previously configured on the WLC for this activity.

g.     Click the Advanced tab.

h.     Scroll down to the FlexConnect portion of the page. Click to enable FlexConnect Local Switching and FlexConnect Local Auth.

i.      Click Apply to enable the new WLAN. If you forget to do this, the WLAN will not operate.

### Step 2: Secure the WLAN

The new WLAN currently has no security in place. This WLAN will initially use WPA2-PSK security. In another activity, you will configure the WLAN to use WPA2-Enterprise, a much better solution for larger wireless networks.

a.     In the WLANs Edit screen for the Floor 2 Employees WLAN, click the Security tab. Under the Layer 2 tab, select WPA+WPA2 from the Layer 2 Security drop down box. This will reveal the WPA parameters.

b.     Click the checkbox next to WPA2 Policy. This will reveal additional security settings. Under Authentication Key Management, enable PSK.

c.     Now you can enter the pre-shared key that will be used by hosts to join the WLAN. Use Cisco123 as the passphrase.

d.     Click Apply to save these settings.

### Step 3: Verify the Settings

ID, Type, Profile name, WLAN SSID, Admin status and Security Policies.

>**NOTE:** Click the WLAN ID if you want to go back to the settings sccreen.

## Part 3: Connect a Host to the WLAN

### Step 1: Connect to the network and verify connectivity

a.     Go to the desktop of Wireless Host and click the PC Wireless tile. Desktop -> PC Wireless

b.     Click the Connect tab. After a brief delay you should see the SSID for the WLAN appear in the table of wireless network names. Select the SSID-5 network and click the Connect button.

c.     Enter the pre-shared key that you configured for the WLAN and click Connect.
