# Packet Tracer - Troubleshoot Static and Default Routes

## Step 1: Locate and document the problems

Can't ping S0/0/0 on R2 from PC1. The default ip route is incorrect on R1 to R2. 172.31.1.195 should be 172.31.1.193

R2 IP routes are backwards. ip route 172.31.1.0 255.255.255.128 172.31.1.198 and ip route 172.31.1.128 255.255.255.192 172.31.1.194.

R3 subnet mask is wrong on ip route. ip route 172.31.1.0 255.255.255.240 Serial0/0/1 should have a subnet mask of 128 because it is a /25 netwok.

R2 - IPv6 static route to LAN 1 incorrect. ipv6 route 2001:DB6:1::/64 2001:DB8:2::194 should be ipv6 route 2001:DB8:1::/64 2001:DB8:2::194

R3 ipv6 is missing a route to Lan 1 2001:DB8:1::/64

## Step 2: Repair the problems

```packet tracer
R1(config)#do show run
R1(config)#no ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.31.1.195
R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.31.1.193
R1#copy running-config startup-config
```

>**Note:** This should fix but didn't let pc1 ping to 172.31.1.193. But after resolving the second issue it does seem to work while those should not be related. Maybe it just needed more time.

```packet tracer
R2(config)#no ip route 172.31.1.0 255.255.255.128 172.31.1.198
R2(config)#ip route 172.31.1.0 255.255.255.128 172.31.1.194
R2(config)#no ip route 172.31.1.128 255.255.255.192 172.31.1.198
R2(config)#ip route 172.31.1.128 255.255.255.192 172.31.1.198
```

```packet tracer
R3(config)#no ip route 172.31.1.0 255.255.255.240 Serial0/0/1
R3(config)#ip route 172.31.1.0 255.255.255.128 Serial0/0/1
```

```packet tracer
R2(config)#no ipv6 route 2001:DB6:1::/64 2001:DB8:2::194
R2(config)#ipv6 route 2001:DB8:1::/64 2001:DB8:2::194
```

>**Note:** When pinging it's entirely possible that the ping reaches the ip you want to ping, but because of wrong ip routes the reply cannot reach you.

```packet tracer
R3(config)#ipv6 route 2001:DB8:1::/64 Serial0/0/1
```
